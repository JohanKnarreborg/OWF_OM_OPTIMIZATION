## Project description 
One of the main cost drivers of offshore wind farms (OWF) is the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) activities conducted throughout the lifetime of a wind farm. As seen in (RÃ¶ckmann, Lagerveld, and Stavenuiter 2017) the cost of O&M related activities can account for up to 25%-30% of the total lifetime costs, and therefore crucial to minimize.

This study aims to reduce the O&M related costs by building a decision making model that can make informed decisions based on forecasts of power prices as well as power production. This will allow an OWF operator to reduce the opportunity costs of shutting down their wind turbines to conduct maintenance and reducing the lifetime cost of the OWF. 


## ðŸš€ Quick start ðŸš€
The model can easlisy be run from the command line. First navigate to the model folder. Make sure you have julia installed and define your julia path. Most likely something like: '/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia'

Call the model.jl file with the applicable model parameters passed as arguments. If you do not have access to a Gurobi license, 'HiGHS' can be passed as the chosen solver. Here is an example model simulation using 12 turbines: 

'/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia' model.jl --p_cost=75 --days=31 --w=12 --e_price=0 --day_start=1  --comment=comment --h_sm_per_turbine=160 --heuristic_turbines=6 --forecast=EWMA --ctvs=1 --crews=2  --year=2021 --solver=Gurobi 

The output will be saved in the output folder in a subfolder named after the parameters used.

##  Model architecture
The OR model is a mixed-integer linear programming model that optimizes the O&M activities for an OWF. The model is based on a rolling horizon approach where the model is solved for each day in the simulation. For each day a part of the OR model is redefined to fit the current day. The basic model running structure is shown below: 

<div align="center">

  <br>
  <em>Model architecture for long-term simulations. </em>
</div> 

The model can be run with a planning horizon of more than 1 day, but only locks in the maintenance plan for the coming day. The maintenance plan is based on the remaining maintenance for each turbine, a weather, and power market forecasts. The planning is done at 12 o'clock noon to allow for the plan to be integrated in the day-ahead market bid. This process is illustrated below:
