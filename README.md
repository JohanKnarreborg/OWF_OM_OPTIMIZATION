  <em>Corrective Maintenance (blue) and Scheduled Maintenance (white) for a yearly simulation for Kriegers FlakðŸ’¨</em>
</div>

## Project description 
One of the main cost drivers of offshore wind farms (OWF) is the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) activities conducted throughout the lifetime of a wind farm. As seen in (RÃ¶ckmann, Lagerveld, and Stavenuiter 2017) the cost of O&M related activities can account for up to 25%-30% of the total lifetime costs, and therefore crucial to minimize.

This study aims to reduce the O&M related costs by building a decision making model that can make informed decisions based on forecasts of power prices as well as power production. This will allow an OWF operator to reduce the opportunity costs of shutting down their wind turbines to conduct maintenance and reducing the lifetime cost of the OWF. 


## ðŸš€ Quick start ðŸš€
The model can easlisy be run from the command line. First navigate to the model folder. Make sure you have julia installed and define your julia path. Most likely something like: '/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia'

Call the model.jl file with the applicable model parameters passed as arguments. If you do not have access to a Gurobi license, 'HiGHS' can be passed as the chosen solver. Here is an example model simulation using 12 turbines: 

'/Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia' model.jl --p_cost=75 --days=31 --w=12 --e_price=0 --day_start=1  --comment=comment --h_sm_per_turbine=160 --heuristic_turbines=6 --forecast=EWMA --ctvs=1 --crews=2  --year=2021 --solver=Gurobi 

The output will be saved in the output folder in a subfolder named after the parameters used. 

## Model parameters 
--p_cost: (Int, default: 75)
Fixed postponement cost.

--days: (Int, default: 365)
Number of days to run the simulation.

--w: (Int, default: 36)
Number of turbines.

--e_price: (Int, default: 0)
Electricity price for a fixed price forecast. (Production optimized)

--day_start: (Int, default: 1)
Start day.

--price_quantile: (Int, default: 0)
Quantile, e.g., 80. If 0 then not used. 

--comment: (String, default: "")
Comment to add to output file.

--h_sm_per_turbine: (Int, default: 160)
Quarters of SM per turbine.

--heuristic_turbines: (Int, default: 5)
Number of turbines used in the matheuristic.

--forecast: (String, default: "EWMA")
Forecast method.

--ctvs: (Int, default: 1)
Number of CTVs.

--crews: (Int, default: 4)
Number of crews.

--naive_method_quarters: (Int, default: 0)
Number of quarters the NAIVE method should do each day. If 0, the NAIVE method is not used.

--naive_method_startday: (Int, default: 5)
Day to start the naive method.

--year: (Int, default: 2021)
Year.

--co2tax: (Int, default: 0)
CO2 tax; if 0, normal fuel cost is used.

--solver: (String, default: "HiGHS")
Either Gurobi or HiGHS solver.

## Output analysis 
The output from each model can be explored using the output analysis notebook. Here example plots for an output analysis is available. 

#### Model output  
The model outputs a number of files containing information about all model decisions. The model outputs are: 

| **File**     | **Type** | **Size**                                 | **Description**                                                                                   |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **r_sm.npy** | Bin      | [quarters, turbine]                      | Whether each turbine has scheduled maintenance performed in each quarter.                         |
| **h_sm.npy** | Int      | [quarters, turbine]                      | How many quarters of scheduled maintenance is remaining for each turbine.                         |
| **r_cm.npy** | Bin      | [quarters, turbine]                      | Whether each turbine has corrective maintenance performed in each quarter.                        |
| **h_cm.npy** | Int      | [quarters, turbine]                      | How many quarters of corrective maintenance is remaining for each turbine.                        |
| **Z.npy**    | Bin      | [CTV, quarters, nodes]                   | Whether each CTV is at node n in quarter t.                                                       |
| **MC.npy**   | Int      | [days]                                   | Daily to total cost of fuel.                                                                      |
| **X.npy**    | Bin      | [quarters, turbine]                      | Whether each turbine is producing in each quarter. Rather use r_sm and h_cm to determine if turbine is running. This will be zero when no wind is forecasted or zero prices are forecasted. |

##  Model architecture
The OR model is a mixed-integer linear programming model that optimizes the O&M activities for an OWF. The model is based on a rolling horizon approach where the model is solved for each day in the simulation. For each day a part of the OR model is redefined to fit the current day. The basic model running structure is shown below:
